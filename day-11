/*I completed a leap year challenge, by creating a program that tells the user which year is and isn't a leap year.
To do this, some conditions were laid:
If the year given is divisble by 4 then it is a leap year but if not, it isn't.
If that same year is divisible by 100 then it is not a leap year and if not, then it is.
If that same year is divisible by 400 then it infact is a leap year and if not, it isn't.

Create a leap year calculator
Create a function called isLeap with an input year*/
function isLeap(year){
//create an if - else statement checking that each conditions are met with their appropriate reurn value
    if (year % 4 ===0 ) {
        if (year % 100 === 0) {
            if (year % 400 === 0) {
               return(" is a leap year.");
            } else {
                return(" is not a leap year.");
            }
        } else {
            return(" is a leap year.");
        }
    } else {
       return(" is not a leap year.");
    }
}
//call the fucntion isLeap with your preferred parameter like for example the year i set.
isLeap(2025);
